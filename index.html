            A small project made by <a href="https://github.com/ENTIREX64">NTrX64</a> (me)
        </h2>

            This is a string generator, which allows you to generate random strings. This generator allows you to generate a string of custom length. Here is how to use it:<br><br><br>
        </p>
        <p1>
            To generate a string, just type in the number of the length you want the string to be
            and click the 'Enter' key. The string will be generated.<br><br>

            For example: If I want to generate a string that is 7 characters long, I would type in '7' and click the 'Enter' key. <br><br>

            You can also reset the screen by typing in 'reset' and clicking the 'Enter' key. This will reset the page, removing all the strings generated. <br><br><br><br><br>

            <ul type="circle"><li>The strings that are generated will never repeat more than once
                <li>The custom length is from 3 to 20, anything other than that wont work (yet)
            </ul>
        </p3>
        <p4>
            <ul><li>Unfortunately, because of an unknown bug, the generator can only display <u>six</u> strings at once. To use it again, you have to reset the generator (using the 'reset' command). I would suggest saving the strings generated (if you need them) before reseting the generator, as the strings displayed will be gone forever once resetted. </li>
            </ul><br><br><br>
